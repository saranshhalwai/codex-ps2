# codex-ps2

## Project Overview
This repository contains solutions to problem statements from the CodeË£ PS2 challenge. The tasks span multiple domains, including Web Development, Blockchain, Machine Learning, Game Development, and Cybersecurity. Each solution demonstrates the implementation of the specified requirements, showcasing various technologies and frameworks.

## Directory Structure

### AIML
Contains solutions related to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:
- **Hobby Predictor**: A deep learning model suggesting hobbies based on input parameters. Models are evaluated using Scikit-Learn, and the best-performing model is included in the pipeline.
- **Stock Screener**: A Python-based tool for analyzing stock price data with visualizations for metrics like daily returns and moving averages.

### WebDev
Houses web development solutions:
- **Weather Web Application**: A front-end application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It integrates with a weather API to fetch and display real-time weather data for specified locations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- For AI/ML tasks: Python 3.x, Scikit-Learn, yfinance, tkinter, pandas and matplotlib.
- For WebDev: A modern web browser and optionally a local server.



### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/codex-ps2.git
   ```


## Usage
Below is an overview:

### AIML
1. **Hobby Predictor**: Run `hobby_predictor.py` with the library scikit-learn and pandas installed.
2. **Stock Screener**: Execute `finance.py` to analyze stock price data and view visualizations. It requires an active internet connection for the yfinance library. Also uses tkinter, pandas and matplotlib.

### WebDev
1. Open `index.html` in the browser to use the Weather Web Application.
2. Script contains API key.
